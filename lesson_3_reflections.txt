When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository allows me to use multiple computers to work on one
    project. Also I can collaborate with people, and if my hard drive dies,
    I will still have my whole project if it is on a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If the project has multiple collaborators, when the other people push their
    commits to the remote repository, you might not want their code yet,
    especially if you are going to have merge conflicts with their code.
