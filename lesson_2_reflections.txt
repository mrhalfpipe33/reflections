What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When a repository is initialized, meta data is created such as the folder .git
  that cannot be seen in file explorer. This meta data allows for the commits
  to work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is not actually a place where the files are stored, it is
  rather a place where the names of the files are stored which allows us to
  quickly commit any files in the staging area whenever we want to.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  I can put a file into the staging area and I can commit it once I have done
  one logical change.
